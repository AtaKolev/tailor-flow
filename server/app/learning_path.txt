Based on your personality traits and career goals, here is a personalised learning path to transition from an Accountant to a Data Engineer:

**Step 1: Introductory Courses**
Start with basic introductory courses to familiarise yourself with the concepts and terminologies of data engineering.

1. [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis): This course is offered by the University of Michigan via Coursera. It will help you get a basic understanding of Python, a key programming language in data engineering. 

2. [Learn SQL Basics for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science): This specialisation from the University of California, Davis via Coursera will teach you the fundamentals of SQL, a language used to communicate with databases.

**Step 2: Intermediate Courses**
After grasping the basics, move to intermediate courses which offer a more in-depth understanding of the subject matter.

3. [Data Engineering with Google Cloud](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gcp-data-engineering): This Professional Certificate program from Google Cloud will help you to understand cloud-based data engineering technologies.

4. [Data Warehousing for Business Intelligence Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-warehousing): This specialisation from the University of Colorado is designed to help you understand data architecture, which is crucial in data engineering.

**Step 3: Advanced Courses**
These courses will help you gain expertise in data engineering tools and technologies.

5. [Big Data Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data): From the University of California, San Diego, this specialisation will teach you how to solve real-world data engineering problems using big data technologies.

6. [Data Engineering on Google Cloud Platform](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-data-engineering): This specialisation is a continuation of the Google Cloud program and will take you through designing, building, analysing, and optimising big data solutions.

**Step 4: Real-World Project**
Lastly, apply what you have learned in real-world projects. This will not only help solidify your knowledge but also showcase your skills to potential employers.
